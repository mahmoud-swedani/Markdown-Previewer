# Build a Markdown PreviewerPassed
* [demo](https://codepen.io/mahmoud-swedani/full/OJgaNQV?editors=0110)

* User Story #1: I can see a textarea element with a corresponding id="editor".

* User Story #2: I can see an element with a corresponding id="preview".

* User Story #3: When I enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.

* User Story #4: When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editor element, the text is rendered as HTML in the #preview element as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).

* User Story #5: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.

* User Story #6: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field should be rendered as HTML in the #preview element.

* Optional Bonus (you do not need to make this test pass): My markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as br (line break) elements.
